
You are tasked with extracting key information from a scientific paper PDF and generating a JSON structure for a slideshow presentation. The goal is to create a concise summary that can be easily converted into slides, with the level of simplification adjustable based on the user's preference.

First, you will be provided with the content of the PDF:

You will also receive a simplification level, which is a number between 1 and 10:

<simplification_level>
{{SIMPLIFICATION_LEVEL}}
</simplification_level>

The simplification level determines how much you should condense and simplify the information.
A level of 1 means minimal simplification (most detailed),
while a level of 10 means maximum simplification (very concise).

Your task is to:
1. Read through the PDF content.
2. Extract relevant information for each field in the JSON structure.
3. Summarize the information based on the given simplification level.

The JSON structure **must** contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "Title": "",
  "AUTHOR_NAMES": [],
  "PAPER_PMID": "",
  "PAPER_DOI": "",
  "Background_Info": "",
  "Patient_Quote": "",
  "Patient_Name": "",
  "Date":"",
  "AIMS": [],
  "Methods": "",
  "Findings": [],
  "Conclusion": "",
  "CHARTS": []
}
```

### The Required Fields
- **Title**: Paper title
- **AUTHOR_NAMES**: List of author names
- **PAPER_PMID**: The paper’s PMID
- **PAPER_DOI**: The paper’s DOI
- **Background_Info**: A condensed background
- **Patient_Quote**: A short patient quote
- **Patient_Name**: Name or identifier for the patient
- **Date**: The date / date range of the study 
- **AIMS**: List of aims or research questions
- **Methods**: Short description of methods
- **Findings**: List of main findings
- **Conclusion**: Main conclusion
- **CHARTS**: **Optional** list of chart objects. (See instructions below.)

### The CHARTS Array (Optional)
We may want to display certain data visually.Ideally only use each chart type once. For each chart you want to generate, add an object to the `"CHARTS"` array with the following structure:

```json
{
  "chart_type": "donut" | "comparison_bars" | "trend_line",
  "chart_title": "",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Ensure that the `"data"` field for each `chart_type` is structured as follows to align with the PowerPoint generation requirements:**

1. **Donut Chart**:
    ```json
    {
      "chart_type": "donut",
      "chart_title": "Prevalence of Serum AFP in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C",
      "data": [
        {"category": "Positive", "value": 23},
        {"category": "Negative", "value": 77}
      ]
    }
    ```

2. **Comparison Bars**:
    ```json
    {
      "chart_type": "comparison_bars",
      "chart_title": "Response Rates by Treatment Group",
      "data": {
        "labels": ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D"],
        "values": [75, 45, 32, 21]
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Trend Line**:
    ```json
    {
      "chart_type": "trend_line",
      "chart_title": "Patient Enrollment Over Time",
      "data": {
        "dates": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul"],
        "values": [10, 15, 25, 20, 30, 35, 28]
      }
    }
    ```

> **Note**: 
> - For **Donut Charts**, provide a list of objects with `"category"` and `"value"` to represent different segments.
> - For **Comparison Bars** and **Trend Lines**, ensure that `"labels"` and `"dates"` respectively correspond to `"values"` to maintain data integrity.
> - If **no** charts are relevant, return an empty `"CHARTS": []`.

You **must** place your JSON output inside `<json_output>` tags. Before providing the JSON, briefly explain your thought process and any challenges you encountered in a `<scratchpad>` section.

**Example Output** (for a mid-level simplification, say level 5) could look like:

```json
{
  "Title": "Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular Health",
  "AUTHOR_NAMES": ["J. Smith", "A. Johnson", "M. Lee"],
  "PAPER_PMID": "12345678",
  "PAPER_DOI": "10.1234/abcd.5678",
  "Background_Info": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death...",
  "Patient_Quote": "I feel healthier and my heart condition improved.",

  "CHARTS": [

        {"category": "Low-Intensity", "value": 60}
      ]
    },
    {
      "chart_type": "trend_line",
      "chart_title": "Enrollment Over Time",
      "data": {
        "dates": ["Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3", "Week 4", "Week 5", "Week 6", "Week 7"],
        "values": [50, 80, 120, 200, 300, 450, 500]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
