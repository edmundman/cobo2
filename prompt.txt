You are tasked with extracting key information from a scientific paper PDF and generating a JSON structure describing a PowerPoint presentation. The level of simplification is {{SIMPLIFICATION_LEVEL}} (1 = minimal, 10 = maximal).

We have the following PowerPoint slide layouts available. Here is their JSON representation for your reference:

{{LAYOUT_INFO_JSON}}

You will receive the PDF as a base64-encoded document. Please:

1. Read the PDF and summarise the key information at the specified simplification level.
2. Decide how many slides to create, and which "layout_name" to use for each slide.
3. For each slide, specify a "layout_name" and a "placeholders" object. In that object:
   - You must indicate which "placeholder_idx" to fill (matching the layout info above).
   - Provide text (via `"text": "..."`) or bullet points (via `"bullets": ["Point 1", "Point 2"]`) for each placeholder, unless you prefer paragraphs of text.
   - Each deck should only have one or two bullet point slides do not go overboard
   - Each deck should have ATLEAST one graph. 
   - If you want to include a chart, use:
     ```json
     {
       "placeholder_idx": 1,
       "chart_type": "donut",
       "chart_data": [
         {"category": "A", "value": 40},
         {"category": "B", "value": 60}
       ]
     }
     ```
   - If you want to include an image, please use `"image_key": "<filename>"`, where `<filename>` is one of the available images listed below.

We also have these images available, you must use all of them do not skip any please:
{{AVAILABLE_IMAGES}}

To include an image on a slide, add something like:

"placeholders": {
  "10": { "image_key": "your_image_filename.png" }
}
```
(Make sure "placeholder_idx" matches an actual image placeholder index from the chosen layout.)

Return **valid JSON** in a top-level object:
```json
{
  "slides": [ ... ]
}


Where each slide has:
{
  "layout_name": "<layout name>",
  "placeholders": {
    "<placeholder_idx>": "String or object describing text/bullets/images/charts"
  }
}

### Output Format

Use this exact structure:

<scratchpad>
[Your reasoning and notes go here.]
</scratchpad>

<json_output>
{
  "slides": [
    ...
  ]
}
</json_output>

1. `<scratchpad>` block: Provide your internal reasoning briefly (if needed).
2. `<json_output>` block: **Only valid JSON** describing the slides.

Ensure the JSON is valid and does not contain any extraneous text.
