You are tasked with extracting key information from a scientific paper PDF and generating a JSON structure describing a PowerPoint presentation. The level of simplification is {{SIMPLIFICATION_LEVEL}} (1 = Academic (complex) , 10 = Patient (simple) ).

We have the following PowerPoint slide layouts available. Here is their JSON representation for your reference:

{{LAYOUT_INFO_JSON}}

You will receive the PDF as a base64-encoded document. Please:

Read the PDF and summarize the key information at the specified simplification level.

Decide how many slides to create and which "layout_name" to use for each slide.

For each slide, specify a "layout_name" and a "placeholders" object. In that object:

Indicate which "placeholder_idx" to fill (matching the layout info above).
Provide content as either:
A well-written paragraph (use this for slides meant to deliver a narrative, such as the introduction and conclusion — these paragraphs should be at least twice as long as the standard text), or
Bullet points (via "bullets": ["Point 1", "Point 2"]) with accompanying short text.
Limit the bullet point slides to one or two per presentation, so the overall tone remains narrative and engaging.
Ensure that the presentation includes at least one graph.
Please make the title quite short and consise 
at a simplication score of 10 it should be really simple
Include a semi-narrative style introduction slide and a semi-narrative style conclusion slide with extended, well-written paragraphs (avoid bullet points on these slides).
If you want to include charts, you may use one of the following chart types:

"donut"

{
  "placeholder_idx": 1,
  "chart_type": "donut",
  "chart_data": [
    { "category": "Female", "value": 60 },
    { "category": "Male", "value": 40 }
  ]
}
Each entry in "chart_data" must contain "category" and "value".

"comparison_bars"

{
  "placeholder_idx": 1,
  "chart_type": "comparison_bars",
  "chart_data": {
    "labels": ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C"],
    "values": [75, 45, 62]
  }
}
Here, "labels" is a list of categories and "values" is a corresponding list of numeric values.

"trend_line"
{
  "placeholder_idx": 1,
  "chart_type": "trend_line",
  "chart_data": {
    "dates": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"],
    "values": [10, 20, 15, 25]
  }
}
Here, "dates" is a list of (often time-based) labels and "values" is a corresponding list of numeric values.

If you want to include an image, please use "image_key": "<filename>", where <filename> is one of the available images listed below.

We also have these images available – you must use all of them; do not skip any: {{AVAILABLE_IMAGES}}

To include an image on a slide, add something like:

"placeholders": {
  "10": { "image_key": "your_image_filename.png" }
}
(Make sure "placeholder_idx" matches an actual image placeholder index from the chosen layout.)

Return valid JSON in a top-level object:

{
  "slides": [ ... ]
}
Where each slide has:

{
  "layout_name": "<layout name>",
  "placeholders": {
    "<placeholder_idx>": "String or object describing text/bullets/images/charts"
  }
}
Output Format
Use this exact structure:

<scratchpad> [Your reasoning and notes go here.] </scratchpad>
<json_output> { "slides": [ ... ] } </json_output>

<scratchpad> block: Provide your internal reasoning briefly (if needed).
<json_output> block: Only valid JSON describing the slides.
Ensure the JSON is valid and does not contain any extraneous text.
